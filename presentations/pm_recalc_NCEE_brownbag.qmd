## EPA PM 2.5 Monitoring Data

 - EPA's PM 2.5 monitoring data housed in the Air Quality System (AQS) is one of our most important data sets
 - used to determine compliance with the NAAQS, in health effects research, to downscale satellite PM data
 - in 2024, EPA *retroactively* changed data for a specific monitor type in the AQS from 2017-2023
 - in 2023, about 400 monitors—nearly half of all PM2.5 monitors—with over 2 million hourly observations were affected by this change
 - original data is still in AQS

 
## Timeline

- July, 2016: EPA approved Teledyne 640/640X as Federal Equivalent Monitors for PM 2.5
- two of a class of monitors that use optical sensors instead of the filters used in Federal Reference Monitors (cheaper and easier to maintain)
- early 2017: states begain using these monitors in their monitoring systems
- these monitors soon showed higher readings compared to collocated Reference Monitors
- March, 2022: CASAC said , “The FEM bias needs to be addressed to make the FRMs and FEMs more comparable." 
- May, 2024: final FRN "Update of PM2.5 Data From T640/T640X PM Mass Monitors"


## Motivation

"The EPA believes it is important to update the historical data in AQS to ensure that the most scientifically accurate data are utilized in peer-reviewed research that support the NAAQS, in particularly when evaluating human health and ecosystem activities."

## Increase in Use of FEMs

## Map of Changes in Affected Monitors

## Next steps

- Fully quantify extent of changes
- Write "user's guide" so researchers can correctly identify data
